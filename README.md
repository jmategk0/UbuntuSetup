# Conductor
A simple scripting tool to help setup Ubuntu 16.04 Boxes.

The Python script "install.py" will read the list of bash commands in "commands.txt" and execute them. 

For example: "sudo python install.py" 

Feel free to customize the commands.txt as desired, just make sure that one and only one command is listed on each line. 

NOTE: This is pre-alpha code. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
